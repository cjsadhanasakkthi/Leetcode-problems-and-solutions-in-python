You are given a string s. Continuously remove duplicates (two of the same character beside each other) until you can't anymore. Return the final string after this.

For example, given s = "abbaca", you can first remove the "bb" to get "aaca". Next, you can remove the "aa" to get "ca". This is the final answer.
